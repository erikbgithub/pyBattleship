Usage

The starting point for getting to know the source code and also your first interactions could be the [main.py](http://github.com/sholvar/pyBattleship/blob/master/main.py). Many other files also have some small examples and interactions prepared, if you run them. If you have any questions that can't be solved with a look in the source code, feel free to contact us.
